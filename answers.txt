Part 1: Write your message here from GitHub
Hello World!

Task 1: 
// Under this line, describe what the command 'git fetch' does
The command 'git fetch' downloads new data from a remote repository without adding it to 
files in the local repository. In order to add the new data to the local files, the command
'git pull' must be run instead. 

Task 2:
// Under this line, describe the difference between Git and GitHub
Git is a version control system that helps developers keep track of changes in their code and files.
It runs locally on your computer. Github is a web hosting service for Git repositories. 
Github also provides a web interface for developers to view changes in their code.
